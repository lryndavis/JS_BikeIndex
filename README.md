By Lauryn Davis + Jeff Seymour

A JS app that utilizes the Bike Index API. A user can search a city of their choice, and return bikes that are currently listed as stolen. Users can view information about the stolen bikes, such as make, model, colors, serial #, and frame model. The app makes an AJAX request, and correctly parses the JSON response.
